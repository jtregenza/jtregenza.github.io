  "At some point, youâ€™ll want to include images, downloads, or other digital assets along with your text content. One common solution is to create a folder in the root of the project directory called something like assets"

*Note: The podcast is currently on hiatus*

They Came From the Silver Screen is a podcast that looks at films and deconstructs the societal issues within them. Episodes range from the the latest film to a deep dive into a collection of films from a director. 

Each episode is hosted by Damian Danaher and myself, where I do the audio production and the design.
