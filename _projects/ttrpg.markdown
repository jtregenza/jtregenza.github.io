  "At some point, youâ€™ll want to include images, downloads, or other digital assets along with your text content. One common solution is to create a folder in the root of the project directory called something like assets"

I used to act, one review of my performances stated I had _"chameleon-like changeability"_. I don't get to act anymore, truth be told the preparation, the ego and political nature of the theatre rubbed me the wrong way one too many times.

I continue to be a theatrical person, in my ways and mannerisms. At an old workplace, my friend introduced me to D&D and I've fallen in love with it. The chance to act a character on a regular basis or craft an entire world as the Dungeon Master is such a pleasure and a source of joy in my life.
