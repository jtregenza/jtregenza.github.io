Due Diligence Magazine was a project I started back in 2012. The goal was to showcase the voices of Brisbane. This was also where I started my journey into design, where I did the branding and logo and website in it's various iterations.

We organised photoshoots and video for fashion, interviewed various local personalities and artists. 

Various writers joined the project and then went on to pursue production companies, their own online magazines and stronger.

I learnt a great deal from the project, especially when to give up the ghost

This project went into archive status in early 2014 when I took greater steps in becoming a designer.
