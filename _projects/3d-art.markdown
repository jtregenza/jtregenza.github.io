  "At some point, youâ€™ll want to include images, downloads, or other digital assets along with your text content. One common solution is to create a folder in the root of the project directory called something like assets"

Creating 3d models and landscapes has been a way for me to unwind and explore my interest for low poly art style. This lead me to be able to more things in game development and has helped understand vr/ar applications for product design. As I said before I enjoy low poly art style and building on that to play with cel shading rendering.
