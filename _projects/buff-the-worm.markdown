Buff the worm is a game where you buff..a...worm. The player is in a dungeon where they have made an uneasy alliance with a giant worm, from there the pair must face an onslaught of enemies where the the worm is best suited to attack the larger enemies, whilst the player character should only take on the lesser enemies. For the player to survive the dungeon they must use their holy powers to buff the worm to improve it's health, attack or defence. This game spun out of an encounter my friends and I had whilst playing Divinity Original Sin where we got into a three way fight and wanted to help the worm as it attacked our mutual foes. 

The game is a top-down 2d pixel art game built in unity.
