In my consistent quest to learn as much as I can and create more things that interest me I have begun creating a video game. Currently titled "Sam Hill", the game is a Farming Sim (Much like Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley) set in the Wild West with dectective elements. The art style I'm working towards is similar to the now cancelled Disney Infinity. 

The game is being built in unity with 3d modelling and rigging done in Blender.
