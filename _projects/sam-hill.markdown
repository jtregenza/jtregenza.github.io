The game of Sam Hill started as a farming sim set in the wild west with some witcher-esque detective elements. Then I got a little more ambitious.

Sam Hill is now a game where you, the player, are brought to a post capitalistic desert world. Ravaged and sucked dry by the mega corporations that have now deserted the planet, leaving those remaining to try and maintain their communities.

The player takes control of their ***customisable character*** and are let loose on the world to create a life for themselves.

The game is a 3d third person action adventure game built in unity.
