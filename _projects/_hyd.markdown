excerpt:
  "At some point, youâ€™ll want to include images, downloads, or other digital assets along with your text content. One common solution is to create a folder in the root of the project directory called something like assets"

Hyd takes the beast out of writing for Jekyll.

Write, style and add images to your article. Hyd then helps you edit and improve the grammar and readability.

When you are ready, add Front Matter and convert the document into Markdown, ready to deploy to your site.

This app was born out the loss in productivity that I have experienced since moving to the Jekyll platform. The act of writing a blog post or article has been laboriously jumping over various other acts in order to improve the grammar, spelling and readibility. Merging these together and bringing in Markdown and YAML intergration personally helps me with my sites but as an open source project, it can be used by any and all who wish it.
