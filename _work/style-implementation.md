Like many of my tasks and accomplishments during my time at working mouse, I was very self starting, I initiated various processes and procedures in how many designers worked, one of which was bringing about CSS, the pre processing extension for CSS. Previously, though you there was less less was being used not particularly well as it was early, just getting started started off with knowing that I could well from the barest I would be able to do media queries far easier in Sass. As my prior knowledge and understanding allowed me to understand I quickly devised ways of us being able to change over to assess and be able to put that within our completion process.

This was working with developers and making sure that that would be able to be put across and that there was a succession plan. So if any old projects were being reused, or worked upon again, that they could be updated to the new Sass as efficiently as possible. Once we had done that I took it upon myself to train many others in how to use cess properly. I did a variety of internal talks about what's asked was, how you could use it, how it can be best utilized. And one of the standpoints of using this extension, what's been out of that was I nearly 10,000 word guideline, or that is called the style implementation guidelines. This was in part, I way for me to make my training of others more efficient, so that they could call upon that that document whenever they required it, when, even if I wasn't there, which would come in handy when I decided that I would no longer be working at work mouse. So I broke the style fermentation guidelines off into three parts, the Sass living, which was to do with a Sass language theory, this was going over what Sass was the parts of Sass.

> ### Excerpt from Variables section
>Variables allow us to reuse values of high repetition. If you are constantly writing out the same color, size, or border value you should instead use a variable in its place. Variables lend themselves to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) methodology and rapid iteration. 
>
>To illustrate this, let's look at this example: Joan's online shopping (password and username reuse stands in for class and variable reuse in a style sheet).
>
>Joan shops through many different websites, and all the sites require a username and a unique password. She has the username no2patriarch690 - this is her alias and represents her. Every time she uses this username, she refers to Joan herself.
>
>This example stands in for styling since the username can be thought of as a variable. It is the same value (no2partriarch690) used in multiple sites (sites are our selectors).

 And speaking about it in plain speech. Previously, I had had trouble in collecting and gaining the knowledge of what all the parts of Sass that were and how best to use them. So I decided to talk about that as a refresher course for myself, and to allow others to get up to speed faster than I could. The next part was, was called into the wild. Now, these were rules to follow when you were styling. This was like, you know, the formatting and syntax how you would state the naming conventions that you would use RGB RGB a instead of hex or hater cell, and then how to structure out your Sass by grouping logical terms. Putting in your includes first, sorry, Your extends first year includes next and the process of how to do that then went into within this I went into vertical rhythm and a lot of type of graphics theory and how you can best use that my last part was an understanding and concepts of how the styles structure would be used in working mouse. To put it briefly there was a funnel style structure where global styles would have components would be passed down through different levels.
 
When it got to an application level, it would then be split into a tile view components and elements sections, each one of them housing the smaller effects so a element would be included in a component component would be included in I view and a tile would be included in a view would be included in a time here, I would also talk about some of my experimental things, the ways that we would be doing breakpoint manages some boilerplate efficiency mix since these would be general slice of life nice to haves with all of this you should be able to work through the guide be able to call upon the guide when you needed to and then from there be able to makes the most of your projects.
