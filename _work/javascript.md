In the beginning, the web was won with HTML & CSS. That was enough for folks. As times passes and new folk come to town, bringing javascript and it's libraries.

While I try and keep things as natural as possible (for accessibility's sake), there comes a time where you need to give in and learn to build pojects with javascript. I've worked on projects where I've coded with React, Angular (the first one, not the newer one), Backbone Marionette and Three.js.

I try to use the right tool for the right job, so when you need to write that vanilla JS instead of bringing in jquery, I roll up my sleeves and get through it.
