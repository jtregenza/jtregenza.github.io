While CSS is perfectly good on it's own, it has a few missteps and inefficiencies. This is where Sass comes into play, as it is an extension of CSS. It adds things like nesting, mixins, variables and functions. Because of this, more advanced Sass starts to look Javascript.

Sass is my preprocessor of choice. During my time with WorkingMouse, I brought Sass into the implementation process and trained many designers how to best use the extension to bring their designs to life.

I have given [various talks about Sass internally](/assets/slide-decks/sass-deck.pdf), during my time at WM, and made extensive documentation for designers and developers alike.
