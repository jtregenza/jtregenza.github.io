Codebots is an AI-powered app building tool designed for people who aren’t classically trained in programming.

I was part of the Lampbot Team where we worked on improving the bot and how it is implemented in the Codebots platform, by way of the Diagram Editor. As we were the first bot team using the Diagram Editor, I would work on the initial design of the Editor and how it was best work with Lampbot’s process. Along with the Product Lead/Design Lead, I would research and test and create ui designs that would be used for the platform.
Codebots is still in it’s beta stage, it has been demoed a events like Myriad, where we took users through building out their own database and frontend views within the Diagram Editor.
Alongside the Design Lead I helped explore the initial branding of Codebots, where I would explore the use of 3D Art to create a titular code bot.
