As mentioned in my ongoing projects (like 3D Art and Sam Hill), 3D Modelling has been a way for me to unwind and de-stress. I use blender (The free 3d modelling program) to model, rig and animate.

From there I can utilise these artefacts as art, place into unity for 3d game development, or in three.js for more product development.

I'm by no means an expert in modelling, it's as deep well as it is nourishing. This is a skill-set that I'm deeply investing in continuing to developed and utilise in my career and my side projects like Sam Hill.
