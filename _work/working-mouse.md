In November 2016, I was hired by WorkingMouse as a Designer. WorkingMouse is an application services business. They build applications across multiple devices with hybrid apps. WorkingMouse utilises code bots to work with their development teams in efficiently producing their projects efficiently.
These code bots are built and maintained by the sister company, Codebots.

During my time there I was able to work with numerous teams and projects. One day I would be designing pull up banners, another I would be assisting developers to design API call builders. I would assist and mentor other designers in how best to style and design out their projects. 

Some of the projects, tasks and accomplishments during my tenure there include:

- Establishing Sass as the preprocessor of choice
- Codifying a style guide for the WorkingMouse Brand
- Designing new back-end system for Lampbot, the premier bot used by WorkingMouse.
- UX Flows, UI Kits and Prototypes to build out these design systems
- Designing new capabilities for Lampbot and itâ€™s users, including Drag & Drop API call builders
- Internal Presentations about styling and stress-mitigation
- UI Designs for prospective and incoming clients
- Robust documentation for new and existing designers for Sass and style implementation.

My time at WorkingMouse was my first with a team of other designers and being able to float ideas and systems by them to develop a collaborative nature. 

The culture of Working Mouse aligned with agile, iterative development through model driven development. While I was able to create UI designs and UX flows, I would also be tackling how the model would operate and understand how best the designer and developer would work.
About a year into my time at WorkingMouse, I officially moved across to Codebots and was the designer for the Lampbot Team.
