I'm not a pixel perfect designer, never claimed to be and never will amount to one. The precision that pixel-perfection takes is unrealistic for the volatility of the world. The only time I will get that granular is when I'm dabbling on the 1's and 2's of pixel art. What started out as a meditative hobby has allowed me to work on game development projects and general chill vibes. 

Aside from the odd playtime activity, I am currently putting pixel art to bring to life a top down dungeon crawler (Buff the Worm)[/projects/buff-the-worm/].
