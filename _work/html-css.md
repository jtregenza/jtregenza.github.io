I am a multidisciplinary designer, as is that I follow many different applications of design. Hell, there are those who would call me a front-end developer (A rose by any other name can still build things).

When I started on my path as a designer I went end to end, from inception to deployment and I still do. This means I play around with the code as much as I play with the pixels. I've worked with Wordpress sites, static sites, Backbone Marionette applications, static site generators, mobile apps, etc. I've not only built but reviewed and improved upon existing DOM structures. 

So whatever buzzword you have picked up for HTML and CSS I've built with it. I work towards making the DOM structure and style of the products I build as sematic, DRY and accessible as they can be.
