      <p>You find yourself in a city of oblivion, where there are no passersby. The air is thick and hangs dry. You look through the blank streets, contrasts of white on white pitter patter this city. You find yourself to be as clear as the lights that flicker the alleys.</p>
      <p><strong>Turn back, to where you can find yourself and friends again. The next time you wander into this city you might become one with the oblivion.</strong></p>
