I'm not a very good student but a great learner. Call it a distaste for authority, distrust of being told what to do blindly or the theatre that is school I've never done well in the tradtional schooling system.

I do love learning, I get a hell of a kick out of learning something and then using  in practice, especially if it's in the real world.
