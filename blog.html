<article class="blog-page">
	<h1>Welcome to flavour country</h1>
	<p>We write to express our thoughts, feelings, to explore our inner workings or just to rank better on google. What I try to write are things that I'm passionate about. That's why you're here, for the passion. In these ramblings I'll talk about design, wit and witisms from someone to young to have the proper notion of a witism, talking about food or just plain olf rambles.</p>
	<p>Whatever I'm writing about, enjoy yourself, have a few laughs or merely a wry grin then feel free to hire me, you owe it to yourself.</p>
	<!-- <p> Things you will find in my writing:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>My thoughts about design,</li>
		<li>Random musings about things on my mind,</li>
		<li>The odd food experience review,</li>
		<li>The wit and witisms of a man making his way to america</li>
		</ul> -->
