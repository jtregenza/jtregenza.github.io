Anthony Bourdain has shaped me in more ways than one. His tv shows have shown me a world that excites and urges me to be apart of. His writing has spoken to me more than any other writer of our time. The first of many books he has written about his life and travels "Kitchen Confidential" is a series of vignettes from a man's life as a chef. It's raw and beautiful in how honest it is. 

Get your hands on A Cook's Tour, The Nasty Bits and Medium Raw as well.
