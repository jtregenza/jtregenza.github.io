Hunter S. Thompson was a strange and revoltionary writer. I was introduced to Thompson from the film directed by Terry Gilliam and then got into his writing and the illustrations of Ralph Steadman, who became linked together in memoriam. 

Fear and Loathing is an excerise in madness and the mirror it shines on what the American dream is for those born into it.
