A lot of people have appropriated this book to their own vision and fucked our world up, don't take it out on this book though. The teachings of sun tzu have helped me look at the world a little differently, giving merit to seeking out knowledge and understanding of things greater than myself before I make decisions and "wage war". There are many versions of this book, I would insist on getting one that has added commetary and examples of war throughout the dynstsies.
