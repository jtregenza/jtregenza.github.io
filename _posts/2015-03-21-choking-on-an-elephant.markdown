I'm in the throes identity crisis, as a person and as a designer. I'm not discouraged by this, self-exploration can lead to one's own betterment.

As I go through, I look back on the decisions I've made, what I am thankful for, the mistakes I've made and how with to be better.

This particular tale has to do with knowing my limits. In the not too distant past, I have tried to land the big job, the big money, even if I didn't know how I was going to pull it off. Fortune favours the bold, right?

Time and time again, I land the big one, the great big elephant then I would pat myself on the back. I would feel great about how I was able to beat the odds to land the job, stroking my infantile ego.

I was a bold and brash man, I wouldn't get down to business as soon as I had won it, no planning, nothing. I let it stay in the room and wouldn't touch it until deadlines loomed. By that time, I would try to eat the elephant, one bite at a time but I had too much to do in  little time and  the stress and anxiety would set in. I would start to spiral into a panic. I was choking on the elephant, far too often.

I didn't catch myself doing it until it's too late. When I do, I got too caught up in fixing the problem that I had created.

If I did solve it, my hubris gets in the way of any real action to better myself,  I pat myself on the back for getting through it. I felt more or less unscathed, and continued the cycle.

I'm not sure if it was a depreciating self-worth or a blow to my ego when I received the much needed peer review.  I've started to look at my behavior and my actions. I'm seeing how they can be more destructive than anything else.

As a designer, I want to be able to create more than I destroy. The next time I land a big job, I will know before anything else that I am prepared to tackle it. I'm going to give it my all and be able to provide the best results to myself, the client and my peers.
