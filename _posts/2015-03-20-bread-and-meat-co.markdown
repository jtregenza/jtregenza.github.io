I'm scouring through the house, trying to find something to eat. I've had a coffee, black, the aftertaste of last night's whiskey still in my mouth. 

I'm hard pressed to find anything to eat on a Saturday morning and I'm not enthused about it.

The clock halts at eleven and eggs and bacon turn to fuller meats wrapped in bread. I throw my boots on and storm out the door, driven to the pursuit of the immediate end to my hunger. Burgers and Americana style food joints are popping up more and more in this city, making it easy for a man like myself to meet that urge. Bread and Meat Co is where I'm heading.

I hope it will stay around longer than the usual occupants of the TCB in the middle of Fortitude Valley.

Right now it's easy to miss, in the midst of the construction work occurring. Part of the renewal of Brisbane's favourite place to get drunk, screw a regrettable person and get in a fight.

I was a man on a mission though, for new and exciting sensory indulgence. Bread and Meat Co. obliges me.

I waltz into the kitschy, Ikea-Europa style joint and am greeted by a North American attendant. There is no visible menu shown anywhere but at the counter, making your decisions quick and for some, daunting. Success loves preparation as I had already checked out the menu on the phone on my walk up.

I got myself a beef brisket foot long, with provolone and aioli with a side of chilli fries. Here is where I make my first misstep. A footlong is a hefty meal in and of itself, especially when it's meat and cheese. Getting the Chilli Fries is asking death to be your co-pilot.

I don't mean this as a negative, just a warning. The chilli fries is a serious meal unto itself. You could sit down to a bowl of it and you'll be quite content.

By the time I found out how big the portions were, I had already slammed down a twenty and had Lloyd pour me a preverbal drink. I was ready to end up in The Overlook Hotel for ever.

My footlong came out on a wooden board and it looked good. At first I thought the crusty roll and meat might be a little dry by as I took my first bite I was immediately mistaken. It was moist meat with a healthy amount of aioli and melted cheese. The dipping sauce to the side (A sandwich staple I'm offended is absent in Australia) ties the meal together. It adds that extra bit of diverse moisture to the sandwich.

Whilst I consumed my own meal, the table to the left of me is hitting the wall, they could not eat anymore. They had had two bowls of chili fries, a pulled pork and corned beef sandwich. One of the chef's comes out, teasing them, taking much delight in what I sure is another victim to the monstrous portions.

I don't blame them for hitting the wall either. The prices are cheap, making you suspect that your meal will be on the smallish side, so you overcompensate.

After the foot long, that wall was coming at me like a steam train conducted by a vengeful ex-girlfriend. A sane man would have stopped, but hunger still had me in it's grasp and I wasn't leaving until I had the behemoth chilli fries.

There are a few things I'm not afraid of, holding a man's gaze and eating by myself. This may have been a time where having someone to watch my food and jacket would have come in handy. I had not had the forethought to grab a fork to eat the fries.

You need the fork, otherwise you look like a drunk Johnny Cash consuming a birthday, which mightn't be your cup of tea. I have made an ass of myself for most of my adult life so a lack of shame helps when it comes to eating with my hands in front of the public.

I did enjoy my meal, a lot, anybody that is able to eat meat, bread and cheese should do as well. Between the sizes of their vast selection and the great price, I struggle to find a time where eating here would be a bad idea. Perhaps if you had exhaustive plans after eating, you may want to put them off. After I had finished I enjoy a well needed, mid afternoon nap.
