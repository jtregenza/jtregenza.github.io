I think I've changed my site design three times, before even showing it to others. This is the fourth.

The previous three were frankensteins of themes I had found on wordpress. 
In wordpress is where I started building websites. Outside of wordpress I've made websites in a customer Cold Fusion CMS. Never static. This is site is static. I'm buidling this site from complete scratch. I'm doing so to learn humility as a designer, to practice my craft, to learn the right skills and hopefully build my development skills enough to evolve this site into something I'm proud of.

At the moment the site has images missing and text not perfect. This isn't the final look.

As I said I'm learning and relearning skills that will, hopefully, make me a better designer. A designer that can do great good.

I'm also using the site as an excuse to make more isometric pixel art. I've taken a great interest in it since discovering eboy. I love their pixelramas, maybe in time I can do soemthing similar.

As I build this site, tweak it, make it better, I will be writing more and growing as a designer.
