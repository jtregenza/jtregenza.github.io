I’m Josh Tregenza, freelance designer, multi-disciplinary and autodidact. I build things for the web, the real world and the ethereal with people just like you. I produce a [podcast](http://fromthesilverscreen.com){:target="_blank"} discussing film and it's impact on the world.

When not helping clients improve their businesses, I’m an aspiring game designer, writer and traveller. To learn more check out my [resume](/assets/JOSH-TREGENZA-OCTOBER-RESUME.pdf){:target="_blank"} or email me at [josh@joshtregenza.com](mailto:josh@joshtregenza.com).
