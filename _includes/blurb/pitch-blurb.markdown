My name is Josh, I make things for myself and others. I want to help you make money in the long term and make sure we have a world that isn’t going to cannibalise itself in the process. 

What does design have to do with that? Design is a form of problem solving and the craft has a number of disciplines to accomplish that, some visual, some systemic  but all surround the human condition.

I’m not here to make things "look pretty", I'm here to de-risk the project you want to take to market, to ensure success for you and the world at large.
