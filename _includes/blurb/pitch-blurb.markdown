Right, let’s get down to business, I want to help you  both make money in the long term and make sure we have a world that isn’t going to cannibalised itself.

I’m not here to just make you pretty pictures (Unless it is all that project is), I’m not here to be a conduit for creativity, I’m here to make sure goals are set, are correct and completed.
