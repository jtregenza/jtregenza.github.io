<p>I did a lot of things before becoming an designer, took the hits, kept moving forward and have been building things with people ever since.</p>
<p>I've been working as a contracted entity for small businesses to help them find greater opportunities on the web. </p>
<p>Based in Australia, doing the immigration process to relocate to America. </p>
<p>I like to write about my experiences, random thoughts and about food, life.
</p>
<p>I make pixel art and low poly to explore the art forms and prepare for AR and VR design.  
</p>
<p>I'm a designer that codes up the projects and knows his way around content strategy. As a contractor, I deep dive into the industries of the businesses I work with, to give them the best outcomes, that we both can accomplish. </p>
