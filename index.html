    <h1> I am an autodidact designer that is curious in the interactions between people and how design plays a part in that communication. I code and build sites for users, alongside companies. </h1>
    <p>I try and learn constantly and grow my skillset and my understanding. I am currently taking courses into development.  I love making pixel and low poly art and building with lego. This site showcases some of my work and I detail my adventures and insights in the world and in my projects. 

    I am currently looking for the opportunity to design in the United States. If you would like to get in touch you can reach me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/joshtregenza">@joshtregenza</a> or email at <a href="mailto:josh@joshtregenza.com">josh@joshtregenza.com</a></p>
