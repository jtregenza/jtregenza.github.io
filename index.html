  <h1>i'm disrupting the way you see josh tregenza :)</h1>
  <p>I build and solve problems with web and experience design. I perform user and buyer research, which aids myself and clients make informed decisions. I also design social media and marketing processes where needed.</p>

  <p>When not designing, I'm questioning everything, a lot. I search for a better way, a better answer and a better way to live the life I've chosen for myself.

  <p>My background is in film, photography and writing but now fervently pursue the craft of design for the past two years.</p>
  <p>I used to run a small web magazine, Due Diligence Magazine. Where I was web master and editor. As I pursue my craft as a designer, the magazine is on extended hiatus.</p>

  <p>I love design, nothing makes me happier than going through the processes of design, whether it's for clients or myself.</p>

  <p>In my spare time I play video games, create pixel art, cook americana and french food and write about eating food made by others. </p>

        <p>Whilst I explore, learn and grow as a designer, this site will be my playground. You'll see me develop and showcase my skills. Parts will change, some noticable, some not. I will blog my thoughts and feelings of this process and my coding will become more comprehension. Poke around and see what you can find</p>
