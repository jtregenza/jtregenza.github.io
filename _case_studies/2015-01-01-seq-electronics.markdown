I'm scouring through the house, trying to find something to eat. I've had a coffee, black, the aftertaste of last night's whiskey still in my mouth. I'm hard pressed to find anything to eat on a Saturday morning and I'm not enthused about it.

The clock halts at eleven and eggs and bacon turn to fuller meats wrapped in bread. I throw my boots on and storm out the door, driven to the pursuit of the immediate end to my hunger. Burgers and Americana style food joints are popping up more and more in this city, making it easy for a man like myself to meet that urge. Bread and Meat Co is where I'm heading.
