_"You guys make things look pretty"_ - Ancient Proverb

##### What even is Design?

When my partner and I first started dated, her coworkers would ask her what I did for a living. She told them I was a designer, to which they immediately assumed that it meant that I designed clothes. She would have to then take the time to explain what I did in more detail.

This is an original sin of the design craft, it's extremely broad and all encompassing term.
As a designer you could be:
- Product Designer (Physical Products)
- Interior Designer
- Fashion Designer
- Industrial Designer
- Jewelry designer
- Game Designer
- UX Designer
- UI Designer
- Graphic Designer
- Web Designer
- etc, etc, etc

We even have gotten to the point where if you refer to yourself as a Product Designer you could be a physical product designer or a digital product designer. My point is that design and those who practice is have a lot of wild names and a lot of unpacking as soon as we use them.

It's helpful to reduce and abstract what a designer and what design is to more tenable place. As Mike Monterio and other designers state, design solves problems within a set of constraints. Those constraints are the qualifiers in the application of design. Think of it like a toolbox with each tool, one for a particular circumstance, right to use. 

- design is a tool to problem solve 
- designers have specific disciplines that they can use
- a designer can call upon one or many of those disciplines 
- does this create risk?
- how to work with a designer
- how designers can use the their craft
- legit we don't just do visuals except when we do
